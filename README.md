# Guess-the-number-console-in-java

Some excercises i did while learning Java 

1. In the while loop of the main() method, code a try block around the statement that uses the parseInt() method to get the number entered by the user.
Then code a catch block that catches the NumberFormatException. by doing the try/catch statement

2. Add code to the catch blockl that displays an error message and uses a continue statement to jump to the beginning of the while loop.

3.Testing the application by entering an invalid number. application should display a user-friendly message and prompt you to try again
